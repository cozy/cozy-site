	"architecture introduction": "Peek under Cozy's hood, and learn what makes it tick.",
	"architecture introduction two": "Behind Cozy's polished and user-friendly interface hides an advanced platform based on modern web technologies. To get a general idea of Cozy's overall architecture, you can think of it as a cake with two layers: Apps and Data.",
	"architecture apps layer": "The main components in the Apps layer include the Controller service responsible for deploying, removing, and updating apps. Controller has its own web-based graphical interface called the Home that lets you administer Cozy: deploy, update, and remove applications as well as modify settings like language, timezone, etc.",
	"architecture datasystem": "The Apps layer sits behind a proxy that acts as a dispatcher, redirecting requests received from external clients (browsers, native apps, third-party services, etc.) to the appropriate apps. The proxy also handles Cozy's authentication and authorization, including registration, login, logout, and password reset operations.",
	"architecture proxy": "The data system in the Data layer enables the storing, querying, and searching of data and files. This system also features services for performing various tasks, such as managing tags and sending emails. The Data layer also includes a database for working with data and a file system for storing, accessing, and managing files. The indexer component is responsible for indexing the stored data for faster and more efficient search.",
	"architecture dataproxy": "Cozy also features the Data Proxy component which keeps a part of the database on a smartphone or laptop in sync with a smaller version of Cozy's main database. This way, Cozy mobile apps (currently only the Files app is supported) can access data as if they were stored locally. This mechanism offers two benefits: better overall performance and support for the offline mode.",

	"community contribute title": "How to contribute",
	"comparison title": "Comparison",
	"comparison introduction": "Cozy is not the only fish in the sea: there are several other platforms that offer similar functionality. How Cozy differs from them and what makes it a better fit for your specific needs? To answer, we compiled a comparison between Cozy and the most popular platforms and services on the market.",
	"comparison introduction two": "comparison introduction two",
	"comparison owncloud": "OwnCloud shares a lot of similarities with Cozy. Like Cozy, ownCloud uses apps to handle common tasks like file hosting and sharing, calendaring, note-taking, photo sharing, etc. There are also third-party apps that can extend the default functionality. Both Cozy and ownCloud make it possible to sync files and photos across multiple platforms and devices. However, there are several key aspects that make Cozy and ownCloud radically different products. First and foremost, ownCloud is designed and built as a team solution while Cozy focuses on being a personal platform. So instead of featuring collaborative editing, user management, and access control, Cozy focuses on making its apps simpler and more appealing. Moreover it allows users to aggregate, manage, and share personal data. In addition to apps, Cozy also supports connectors that can collect your personal data from various sources and services. This data can then be processed and analyzed in Cozy and shared across Cozy apps. This makes Cozy an ideal platform for aggregating and rationalizing your data spread over multiple services.",
	"comparison pydio": "Cozy, like Pydio can be used for hosting and sharing files, but there are significant differences between these two platforms. Pydio focuses solely on file hosting, and the platform is geared towards businesses and workgroups. As such, Pydio provides advanced functionality essential for its intended clients: sophisticated user management and access control mechanisms, support for workspaces, analytics, LDAP support, etc. The Cozy's Files app, in turn, is designed to make file hosting and sharing as easy as possible, and it is aimed at individual users looking for a quick and simple way to publish files and share them with friends and families. Also, Cozy's file sharing capabilities are only part of the overall package. This means that you can use Cozy not only to host and share files, but also to manage your calendar and work with email, aggregate your personal data and much more.",
	"comparison lima": "Lima is a hardware device running proprietary software. Connect a hard disk to the device, plug Lima into your router, and you have cloud-enabled storage. You can access files and photos, sync them across different devices, and that's pretty much it. Unlike Cozy, Lima doesn't allow you to host your own calendar, access email, or install additional apps. Moreover, it's closed source. So you don't know what happens under the hood. In short, Lima can come in handy if you only want to access and manage your files and don't care about privacy, but if you do, Cozy is the way to go.",
	"comparison sandstorm": "Even though Sandstorm is described as a personal cloud platform, it's very different from Cozy. Sandstorm's raison d'être is to simplify the deployment of popular open source applications. So if you want to host a WordPress blog, a MediaWiki-powered wiki, or manage your email using Roundcube, Sandstorm can help you to deploy these and other apps on your server with a minimum of effort. Simply put, Sandstorm is basically a tool that simplifies the installation and management of third-party open source apps, and not an integrated cloud platform that offers a cohesive user experience. Cozy, in turn, offers a tightly integrated environment which features purpose-built apps with a uniform design. Data stored in Cozy can flow between the apps, and each app has a strong focus on simplicity and usability. In addition to that, Cozy provides synchronization capabilities and mobile apps.",
	"comparison google": "Google offers a range of excellent apps and services: Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Photos, just to name a few. There is a lot to like about Google apps. They are free, they work well on mobile platforms, feature synchronization functionality, and some of them even work offline. Cozy features apps that allow you to do essentially the same: store and share files and photos, manage your calendar, work with email (including your Gmail account), etc. You can also sync your files between your mobile device and Cozy. The big difference between Cozy and Google are their goal. To put it bluntly, Google is building a web universe - made up of your working and private life - which supplies Google with a stream of data that they can use for commercial purposes. Cozy's goal is to provide you with a personal platform that you can adapt to your specific needs, tweak, and run from the convenience of your home. More importantly, you can use Cozy as a foundation for your own projects and experiments: from building custom apps to aggregating and analyzing personal data. In other words, instead of treating you as a passive customer and locking in proprietary products, Cozy empowers you by offering you an open and free platform you can use and build upon.",
	"comparison icloud": "Comparing Cozy and iCloud is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, but there are a couple of points worth mentioning. First of all, iCloud is designed to work exclusively with Apple devices. The service is also limited in scope, offering only synchronization and backup functionality. Unlike iCloud, Cozy is not merely a service but a platform that can run apps, keep data in sync, and collect data from external sources.",
	"faq title": "FAQ",
	"faq introduction": "To save you time and effort, we compiled a list of frequently-asked questions about Cozy.",
	"faq question one.": "Does Cozy encrypt my data?",
	"faq answer one.": "Cozy encrypts passwords and connections. The data stored in Cozy is not encrypted, this would negatively affect the overall user experience. We are considering implementing partial encryption of data stored in Cozy.",
	"faq question two.": "What is your business model?",
	"faq answer two.": "Our business model is described in the 'About Cozy' page.",
	"faq question three.": "How much does Cozy cost?",
	"faq answer three.": "Cozy is available free of charge as software you can run on your own Linux machine. The hosted version of Cozy is free during the beta period. After that, the hosting plan is expected to cost between €5 and €10 per month.",
	"faq question four.": "Can I install Cozy on a Windows or Mac OS X machine?",
	"faq answer four.": "Not directly, but we provide Cozy as a virtual machine image, so you can run it using VirtualBox.",
	"faq question five.": "How do I install and run Cozy?",
	"faq answer five.": "You have several options to choose from. You can install Cozy on your own Linux machine or Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. This is by far the easiest way to have Cozy running in no time. Alternatively, you can install Cozy on a virtual private server (VPS), and there are several excellent VPS providers out there, including Digital Ocean. If you want to give Cozy a try without installing it, you can request a Cozy test instance. Soon you'll also be able to sign up for a hosted version of Cozy.",
	"faq question six.": "Can I test Cozy without installing it?",
	"faq answer six.": "You can do that by submitting subscribing to our beta program (click on the Try for free button). You'll be added to a waiting list, and as soon as we set up a Cozy test instance for you, you'll receive an activation link via email.",
	"faq question seven.": "Can I create accounts for my family and friends on my Cozy server?",
	"faq answer seven.": "Since Cozy is a personal server, it doesn't support multiple user accounts. This makes Cozy more secure and dramatically simplifies server administration.",
	"faq question eight.": "Can I sync files between my computer and Cozy?",
	"faq answer eight.": "Right now, to store files on your Cozy server, you need to upload them to the Files app. We are working on a multi-platform (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) tool that will make it possible to automatically sync files between a desktop machine or laptop and the Cozy server. You can use the Cozy mobile app to sync files, photos, and contacts between the Cozy server and an Android device.",
	"faq question nine.": "Is there a Cozy app for iOS?",
	"faq answer nine.": "We plan to start working on it very soon.",
	"faq question ten.": "Can I share a calendar with a friend?",
	"faq answer ten.": "Not at the moment, but this feature is on our roadmap.",
	"faq question eleven.": "How can I help Cozy?",
	"faq answer eleven.": "The best way to help Cozy is to join our community. See the Community page for further info.",
	"faq question twelve.": "Looks like Cozy is based on Debian. Can I access the underlying system?",
	"faq answer twelve.": "Cozy is a platform as a service, and not a virtual server. While you can access the underlying system via a terminal, it has very limited rights -- which means that you can't do much with it.",
	"faq question thirteen.": "Can I install another server on my Cozy instance?",
	"faq answer thirteen.": "If you host Cozy on your own machine, you are free to install any other server on it. However, a managed Cozy instance sits behind a reverse proxy that accepts connections on port 443 only, so it's not possible to access other servers running on different ports.",
	"faq question fourteen.": "Can I use Cozy as an email server?",
	"faq answer fourteen.": "Cozy is not designed to act as a dedicated email server. You can use the Emails app to send and receive emails using your existing email service, though.",
	"faq question fifteen.": "Can I install my favorite PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. application on Cozy?",
	"faq answer fifteen.": "Currently Cozy supports only Node.js applications.",
